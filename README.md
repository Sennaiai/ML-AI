# Machine Learning Portfolio
Classical ML and optimization baselines supporting my quantum and computational biology work.

## Structure
- notebooks/optimization: classical optimization benchmarks and methods
- notebooks/learning: regression/classification models (e.g., linear regression, random forest)
- notebooks/forecasting: time-series and forecasting baselines (e.g., grid load forecasting)
- resources: references, notes, datasets, utilities
