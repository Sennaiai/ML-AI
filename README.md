## Overview

This repository contains my applied machine learning portfolio, focused on building rigorous, reproducible models for quantitative and scientific problem-solving.

The work emphasizes machine learning as a modeling framework rather than a black box, integrating statistical foundations, clean data pipelines, and principled evaluation into end-to-end analytical workflows.

## Repository Structure

**notebooks/**  
Project notebooks organized by modeling task:

- `forecasting/` — time-series and predictive models  
- `learning/` — supervised and unsupervised methods  
- `optimization/` — regression, objective modeling, and tuning  

Each notebook is fully self-documented.

**resources/**  
Supporting references and methodological notes.

## Orientation

The focus is on interpretable, well-validated models designed for real-world analytical and scientific applications.
